<p>Hello, I'm Maitreya Das, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering">Electrical Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.iitism.ac.in/">IIT(ISM) Dhanbad</a>. As I progress through my third semester, I remain deeply enthusiastic about the world of technology, always striving to stay updated with the latest advancements in this ever-evolving domain. My academic journey has fueled my passion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Data Science</a> and machine learning, as well as the innovative concepts surrounding renewable energy.</p>

<p>I have a profound interest in the potential of renewable energy and the urgent need for decarbonizing the global economy. I strongly believe that <a href="https://www.iberdrola.com/about-us/decarbonized-economy-principles-regulatory-actions#:~:text=Decarbonisation%20is%20the%20process%20of,neutrality%20via%20the%20energy%20transition.">decarbonization</a> is the key to mitigating mankind's environmental impact and ensuring a sustainable future. This conviction drives me to explore and contribute to solutions that can help prolong, if not entirely prevent, the adverse effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">climate change</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I am an avid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">cricket</a> fan, passionately following international matches and the Indian Premier League. My love for the sport provides a perfect balance to my academic endeavors. Additionally, I have a deep appreciation for music, with a diverse taste that spans from classical compositions to rock anthems. Music, much like cricket, serves as a source of inspiration and relaxation for me.</p>
